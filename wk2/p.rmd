## Assignment -1 
  **This is first assignment **

## Code Chunk:
 this is a sentence
```{r }
2+2
```
  

##  Code Chunk Options:   
Chunk output can be customized with knitr options, arguments set in the {} of a chunk header[reference: 1] :   

  * include = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.  
  * echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.  
  * message = FALSE prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.  
  * warning = FALSE prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.  
  * fig.cap = "..." adds a caption to graphical results.  


## Rmarkdown Working:  

This may sound complicated, but R Markdown makes it extremely simple by encapsulating all of the above processing into a single render function. [reference: 1]


## RMarkdown Basics:

### Priting in italics:
*Italics*  
_Italics_


### Priting in bold:
**Bold**  
__Bold__


### Wiritng Sentences:

### Unorderd List:
* This is item 1
* This is item 2
    + This is sub-item 2-1


### Orderd List:
1. This is item 1
2. This is item 2
    + This is sub-item 2-1


###  Superscript:  
superscript^2^  
10^2^ 

###  Subscript:  
superscript~2~  


### Equations:
1. Mean in words   
$${Mean} = \frac{Summation~of~values}{Total~sample~size}$$
  
2. Mean in mathematical expressions
$${\mu} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}$$

#### Some other commonly used symbols:  
**Sigma:**  $\sigma$  
**Pi:**  $\pi$   
**Alpha:**  $\alpha$  
**Lambda:**  $\lambda$    
**Greater than or equal to:**  $\ge$  
**Less than or equal to:** $\le$  
**Plus or minus:**  $\pm$  

## Lets write some R code now:
#### 1. View the data
```{r}
volcanic_data = faithful
head(volcanic_data)
```


```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(volcanic_data[1:6,], caption = "Volcanic data table in a neat way")
```


#### 2. Let us do a scatter plot
```{r echo = FALSE}
plot(volcanic_data)
```

#### 3. What is the summary of the dataset
```{r}
summary(volcanic_data)
```

```{r}
2+ 4
```

## Practice:  
1. Refer to the lecture notes and write the following equations in Rmarkdown:   

  * mean
  * median
  * variance
  * standard deviation
  * IQR
  
$${\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}}$$
  
2. Read in the internal dataset mtcars and see the summary of the dataset in Rmakrdown. Report the mean of horse power (column hp) as hp_bar = xxx value  (write hp_bar in equation notations)  
```{r}
cars_data = mtcars
summary(mtcars)
m = mean(mtcars$cyl)
```

The mean of number of cylinders is:
$$ \bar{cyl} = `r m`$$
